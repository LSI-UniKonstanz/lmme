/**
 * This class is required by VANTED in order to recognize the LMME Add-on.
 * 
 * LMME allows to decompose a large metabolic network into smaller subsystems.
 * The decomposition is not only performed in the background but the system
 * produces an overview graph that consists of individual subsystems. A
 * subsystem formally contains a subgraph of the original graph. The user can
 * choose several different approaches to decompose the initial network, e.g.
 * based on notes in the underlying SBML file (either direct subsystem notes -
 * or KEGG reaction id notes that can then be resolved to individual pathways
 * via KEGG API requests). There are also structural decomposition methods that
 * do not expect any notes or annotations within the underlying SBML file.
 * Finally, there is an overview graph and several subsystem graphs. The
 * subsystem graphs may then be visualised on demand by selecting them in the
 * overview graph.
